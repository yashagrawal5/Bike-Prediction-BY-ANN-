# Predict Bike Rental Usage with ANNs

A bicycle-sharing system is a platform where users can rent / use electric bikes that are available for shared use for a short-term price or free. Our data-set is a csv file  with information from 17,379 hours over 731 days with 16 features (information categories) for each hour. The features are:

__instant:__ record index

__dteday :__ date

__season :__ season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)

__yr :__ year (0: 2011, 1:2012)

__mnth : month ( 1 to 12)

__hr :__ hour (0 to 23)

__holiday :__ wether day is holiday or not (extracted from http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)

__weekday :__ day of the week

__workingday :__ if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.
__weathersit :__

__1:__ Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy

__2:__ Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist

__3:__ Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds

__4:__ Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog

__temp :__ Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are divided to 41 (max)

__hum:__ Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)

__windspeed:__ Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)

__casual:__ count of casual users

__registered:__ count of registered users

__cnt:__ count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered


In this project, I have used Artificial Neural Networks, not classic Machine Learning algorithms. When we evaluate our model by looking at the values above, MAP and MLE give us very similar results, as is expected when we use MAP without any prior information about the target function we are trying to derive.
